# Web Template

This is a starter project for web development with minimal frameworks. It is meant to be a
fake site about hot air balloons as well as an experiment into formatting a webpage using grids, flexboxes, and other such structures.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the necessary dependencies for the project. However, as this is a simple tempate test, it is unlikely that running the command for dependencies is needed.

Instead, to get started clone this repository and install the "Live server" or "Live Preview" extention.
After that, click the "Start Preview" button that appears on the bottom right side of the VSCode window to
launch a new chrome window that will show the imitation website as intended. Any updates made will reflect on the live server immediately.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

To launch the server, click the "Start Preview" button that appears on the bottom right side of the VSCode window.

For the development of this webpage about hot air balloons, it went fairly well all things considered. It certianly helped that all of our goals were so cleanly laid out in the assignment. I appreciate having something not as high profile to work on the week before exam week. It makes things just a little bit less stressful.

## Testing

There are no tests for this website, as it was just an attempt to work with formating and templates.
